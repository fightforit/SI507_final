The new location is very nice and is much more modern to their old location.\n\nFirst things first, don\u2019t forget this place is CASH ONLY. The service still isn\u2019t the greatest. The staff isn\u2019t very friendly and rarely do you see anyone smile there, but hey, we know why we all come here\u2026 THE SOUP DUMPLINGS. My favorite is the pork dumplings. If you really like crab, you\u2019ll enjoy the crab ones. They have a hint of a seafood taste, but I prefer sticking to the pork.\n\nWe wanted honey chicken, but they don\u2019t have that so we got the sweet and sour chicken. Portion size was pretty small. It was not even close to being worth $21. It\u2019s more sour than sweet. We were told it came with rice, but we had to flag someone down to ask for rice and they brought this time little portion that is not a shareable portion. I wasn\u2019t a big fan; would have preferred another order of dumplings instead.\n\nA lot of first timers come here and I noticed they have no idea how to eat the dumplings. I educated the table next to me as I noticed they were trying to look over to see how it was done.\n\nI thought this little verbal tutorial might help:\n(Check out my photos to see the examples numbered for this description)\n\n1. Use the tongs to gently grab the dumpling at the very top. If you are too rough, it could pierce and cause you to lose your soup.\n3. Place dumpling on your mini soup spoon.\n4. Bite a tiny hole near the top.\n5. Use chopsticks to hold the dumpling up while you drink the soup then devour.\n\u2705If your plate looks like this in the end, great success!\n\u274cFAIL.\n\nPS: Careful eating your first dumpling. They are extremely hot when they come to the table. Give it a min or two to cool down. Hope this was helpful. Enjoy!",

Decided to go in person the day right when they opened for lunch of to try my luck...special kudos to the hostess (unfortunately didn't catch her name) who not only managed to carve out a spot for us within the time range that worked for us, but put us in a beautiful private dining room on the second floor which was totally unexpected! Had a space to even hang up coats and store bags.\n\nAdditional special kudos to our server Alex who was super helpful and proactive - we had a couple folks who accidentally dropped their chopsticks on the floor, and before we even had a chance to ask Alex for replacements, he already came by with new ones!\n\nApart from the great service, you probably care more about the food...we literally ordered almost half the entire menu. Everything was great! I particularly liked the Spicy Soft Shell Crabs and the Curiously Tasty Chicken, but everything was great, and everyone liked everything.\n\nThey have their liquor license now too! Great times all around! Highly recommended, even if you're not in the area. Cheers",

The tea soaked duck however, was barely edible as almost the entire dish was fat. I love the skin, but when the fat is accounting for 75% of the actual dish, it becomes sickening to eat any more than three bites. The drinks are strong, but for the $15 price, I\u2019d expect some type of garnish, not foam from the ice shaker or small bits of ice leftover.",

I was the fifth in line.  I noticed it was a lady instead of 2 men as I remembered manning the cutting board.  And for 15 whole minutes she did not serve one single person, just keep cutting and moving meats. The line was like 12 people by now and everyone was really annoyed; me especially because my wife was waiting in the car which was in a \"temporary\" spot. When the line finally started moving, it was still much slower than I had remembered because it was now a one-man operation. I ended up spending 30 minutes waiting before I finally get to order my duck lunchboxes. In retrospect, I figured the man must have been late and the lady was just buying time help getting thing ready.\n\nIn exchange for the long wait was not fruition but even more disappointments. The large size boxes that I ordered were now more like 90 part white rice, 5 part cabbage, and 5 part duck.  And aside from the drum piece, the duck was essentially fat and bones, and it was not flavorful nor savory to go with any rice.  In the end I'm left with a gross amount of rice with nothing to go with it.  OK, the price may have only gone up by $1.25 but the quality and value had gone down the drain.\n\nIf I do come back at all, the only thing I'll get would be the BBQ pork.  At least it's boneless and it would go with rice much better than the pathetic duck they served me on this visit.",

Their food is great and they definitely have the secret sauce. I recommend getting roast pork. It's just mouth watering good.\n\nThe issue from observation from years of visiting this place is that there's only one person chopping the meat and handling the cash. Lately, there's finally someone collecting the cash after the items are boxed. That still leaves 90% of the work to one person that's overworked when servicing customers.\n\nWhat the owner needs is more people streamlining the chopping and packaging. Why can't the cashier also fill boxes with rice for those ordering? And for the person chopping, it's a damn hard job to do all day with something razor sharp butcher knife and it is heavy. If they bought an automated chopper, the line would move so much faster and they'd make so much more money while at it for a few person operation. We all want to see this place grow in volume and thrive. Their growth has been stagnant since the dawn of time. And while this isn't somewhat foreseeable in the future, those $2.50 mini lunch boxes were such a hit, I'd want that coming back some day. It's a quick meal it's always been filling to keep me going when I pass by.",

The most I've paid for a Large Combo is $11 which included, at least, a quarter duck but most everything else is $4.75-$9. The regular single portions at around $5 is more than enough for 2 to share \ud83c\udf8e! There's no sit down/eat in, hence the line.",

The soup was rich and so very comforting on a cool autumn day. The octopus was reminiscent of grilled octopus like they make it in Italy, and it was perfectly cooked!\n\nThe pizza, however, was the best part! I loved both pies but the Vodka Pizza was my favorite. The sauce was amazing and cheesy. The Bianca Pizza was great as well!

That does not surprise me, because their food is simple, yet delicious. The prices are higher today, of course, but my go-to dish is still on the (Specials) menu--the Veal Milanese--and it is worth every penny. I remember when it was on the original menu, and it read something like \"served with a nice little salad,\" and it still is. The veal is lightly breaded, quickly fried in butter in a pan on the stove (I sat at the bar and watched them make it). It is plated next to the salad, which is indeed simple but a perfect accompaniment, along with half a lemon to squeeze over everything. It's fun to do, and I tend to use every drop. This dish could be a \"last meal\" dish for me, I love it that much, even well over a decade since I first had it. Also see the photo of the bread with the white beans in oil. Not enough places start with a thoughtful complimentary starter (or anything complementary at all), but they do. And it's tasty. As long as Supper is still around, it's worth me trekking there whenever I visit New York. And one other thing to mention, considering so many places have gone to card-only, this place has stuck to the CASH ONLY format (they have their own ATM in the back).",

In a super tight and compact restaurant. Wear your mask correctly covering your nose if you're going to be talking to everyone inches from their face!\n\nOn top of that, I asked her for my pizza as I tried to wait outside (to avoid being in that corner) and she forgot! So I had to get back inside the crowded corner, wait to get her attention again to get the pizza. What a mess. All those people should be outside waiting to be handed their pizza. Not all huddled in one corner during 20,000+ daily cases.\n\nShe was also doubling as the server. Which means the restaurant may be the one at fault here for this poor management.\n\nLastly, when I finally did get my pizza, it was soggy. :-(\n-------------------\nThe best specialty pizza in NYC.

Our server was Jade and they were absolutely incredible. Cheerful, informative, and chatty. I loved it!\n\nI had the mac and cheese pancakes, and they were an actual work of art. The combination of the cheese sauce and the spicy honey made them perfect. I could only eat half of what they brought me, but it wouldn't surprise me if that's a common situation because the portions are so large.\n\nThe coffee was great and the bathrooms were large and clean.

The combination between spicy mango sauce and shrimp tempura is really refreshing.\n\nHowever, this might not be the best choice for people love traditional Japanese sushi, and the price is not that cheap.\n\nStill, a recommended fusion sushi & hand roll bar!",

They made me wait outside in the cold and didn\u2019t offer for me to wait indoors. At 25 minutes I asked them if it\u2019s close to being ready and the server said the kitchen is really busy. I requested him to check on my order for me so he came back and said another 10 minutes, at this point the estimated wait to PICK UP and order IN PERSON is 40 minutes?! Uber delivery orders work faster than this and if I were to sit and eat there is NO way they would make a customer wait for 40 minutes. I\u2019m shocked and astonished because this is a well established restaurant and for them to give me such bad service is so beyond disrespectful, had I known it would take this long I would\u2019ve ordered food elsewhere.

Please use a safer method to keep the dishes warm at the tables. On a windy and cold day for those seated by the entrance, the flame was a safety hazard it almost caught the ladies' hairs on fire. We do not know how many times we asked for the doors to be closed shut\n\n3) Please have an ethical practice and don't try to rob us.

He arrived at the restaurant earlier than me. When he went inside the server made him wait outside in the cold rain before being seated. This is understandable as there is not much indoor seating as is. However, the server did not let him touch the heater.\n\nWhen I arrived and we sat down the server visited us twice between a few minutes to take our order. We felt rushed that we needed to choose as if they wanted us to order food, eat, and get out so the next customer could come.\n\nAt the end of our meal, I paid for both of our meals as a courteous host would do for a good friend they haven't seen in a long time. After I signed the receipt, I wasn't mindful of the \"Suggested\" percentage of the tip as I was talking to my friend. However at the point, I also didn't believe service was worthy of a great tip. Another server came back to our table and asked me why I didn't tip the \"Suggested\" amount. I was phased out because that has never happened to me and I wouldn't be surprised if the server had done that to other customers as well. I told her I was a student and she proceeded to say, \"we make a living off of this.\" I understand this because I too was once a host at a restaurant. However, the way the server handled the situation was not appropriate. I was insulted in front my of my visiting friend who ended up paying a $10 bill to make them happy. It was very embarrassing for me in front of my visiting friend who is also a student.\n\nThe management should know that they are near a university where many students don't have that much money to spend and if the servers are not making enough in tips then the management should pay their servers more otherwise the servers should leave and find a better paying position. Based on the amount of good reviews the restaurant has, it should be making well and if not, then fix the service. Good restaurant businesses are honest, pay their servers well, teach their waiters to be kind and friendly and also let people enjoy their meal. I also don't know how credible the \"Halal\" sticker is. This place serves alcohol and true halal places don't. If the food truly isn't from a halal supplier then management should be ashamed for tricking so many people only to get more business. Dishonesty always fails.",

One thing I have to say is that the dessert I tried was fried ice-cream & worse one I ever had. After only 1 bite I had to return it back. 15$ just went to trash, they also didn\u2019t offer me anything else or asked if I want anything else on the house. That\u2019s what they supposed to do. That\u2019s a bummer! Besides the ice-cream I actually enjoyed the rest of my food. But only because the price is high I am not gonna probably come that often.\nAnother thing I have to say is that like all the other Asian places where after you say something they talk in their language & you feel like they r talking about u. I feel like they should always talk in English, especially when they r fluent in it. It made me very uncomfortable! I m pretty sure lots of people will know what I meant .",

Everything was so fresh and bright, the beef was delectable, the pork was flavorful and tender. Just everything we ate was pretty perfect and very reasonably priced.

All throughout the dining experience, they were very attentive (took my beer bottle away as soon as it was empty, etc).\n\nI went ahead with the lamb chops as per recommendation and it was amazing, very well seasoned and the meat itself was of high quality. Personally, I eat a lot of lamb and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve tasted anything like it before. My friend\u2019s vegetarian dish was also very nice, and the butter roti was crispy and delicious. Portion size was pretty standard and I was very happy with the prices!\n\nI usually don\u2019t write reviews but this was the kind of experience that makes you go \u201cman I NEED to write a review and tell people about this place.\u201d Honestly felt like I was being served by family rather than strangers.",

We dealt with 3 different staff at our table, I believe one was a manager based off how aware she was. But unfortunately her serving style wasn\u2019t enough to counter the negativity/disregard we felt from the other 2 people.\nThe octopus dish was lacking, $20, and as one of the waiters was putting the beets on our table he wasn\u2019t paying attention, or Something, and placed the beats down over the octopus dish, nearly knocked out what little octopus was served - without no word or acknowledgement of the rude moment.\nThe chicken was good, juicy. The potatoes was good too. I had the soup which worked for me but know it\u2019s like a very basic flavored chicken soup, just creamy. The lamb w fennel was a great portion size I didn\u2019t taste it tho it was my friends.\n\nOverall I\u2019d maybe try it during the day time. Night staff was not kind to our table. Which I found peculiar. I sat with view of the entire floor of their back room and watched their interactions with other tables-of ppl who looked like them. Majority white staff that night. Food was good but not worth the way we were disregarded.",

Spoke to us about his background with the back story of the restaurant, he also has a great story to tell of him self, along with a great personality. I recommend everything on the menu. The one thing I didn\u2019t have was a desert because I didn\u2019t have room for more! I am definitely coming back for it. I had grilled octopus as an appetizer, then ordered the lamb kabob with fried potatoes. The meat was nice and soft. My mother had the lamb chops with lemon potatoes super soft and tender, I definitely recommend it here! It\u2019s my new favorites spot!",

Food has changed and the only item that remains decent is the guacamole. Not recommended. Will find another spot for tacos and sports. It was that disappointing.",

Please do make a reservation of you have a large party (5 or more people). Rather be safe than sorry just in case, as this seems to be a fairly popular restaurant. Weekends during the winter may get a little crowded, although they do have seating outside (would probably only recommend during the Summer). Staff were accommodating and friendly, made some great suggestions for drinks, and treated us to a round of shots (for the birthday girls ;) )! They also have brunch drink specials (Monday through Thursday, 4-10pm, Saturday and Sunday 12-4pm)! I loved the indoor decor, feels very intimate and cozy! If you love Mexican, I'd definitely recommend giving them a try! Drinks aren't too bad price wise, if you enjoy brunch... They have a variety of options that include prosecco! Their appetizers and entrees are fairly priced as well.",
