However, for us, we will ask them to be gentle on the salt (and also chilies) next time.

While Chia Shiang does have the standard offering of Americanized Chinese food the real treasure is a few more pages into the menu. Yes the menu is large and does not have great descriptions but that does not matter because all the food is awesome. I have tried things here that I would never try other places and it is very rare I have a dish I dont like. The staff does not speak the best English but they do work hard. This place can be a rewarding adventure for those looking to get away from the same old plates. Eat Local, Eat Here!\n\nUpdate 2021: 6/19/2021\nI ordered takeout recently and did not get what I was expecting. So the next time I called I was very specific about what I wanted. I was told they have a new chef and the menu has changed. The guy on the phone did not know what happened to the couple that used to run the restaurant. Not sure what this will be like when they reopen for dine in...but the takeout food I have got has not been the same quality.",

I grew up in Texas and have become deeply fond of *anything* that resembles the variety and depth of flavor found in genuine Latin food. Beyond Borders does that in spades. Still, the better quality of the place is that the food is made by people who are passionate about their food. You can tell, even as you enter the unassuming restaurant, that they have taken great pains to ensure that their food is delicious. Talking with the owner, I was excited to learn about his process\u2014which showed great care for the ingredients and final product. I highly recommend this place.\n\nOh, and today I had the Torro sandwich. Have him make it spicy. It's delicious.",
