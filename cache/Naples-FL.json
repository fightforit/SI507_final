Naples is the place for seafood, USS Nemo is where you get it upscale and elegant in the French style.  Recon the place at lunch.  Entrees are from about the same menu, but it will give you a chance to evaluate the very poor audio characteristics of the place which has a tin ceiling.  Not the fault of the chef-owner, but can be very noisy in the evening when at capacity and people are drinking.  Otherwise, superb in both food and service.",

They weren't horrible, I just didn't like them. I told my server and asked to have it removed from my bill since I didn't want them. He was apologetic and kind. He did exactly what he should have done. I must say he was one of the best servers I've had since moving to Naples 14 years ago. He is a model server.\nThen.... what I assume is the manager, an older Asian woman, came to my table obviously upset and offended that I didn't want them. She asked rather harshly what was wrong with them. I explained I found them over cooked. That they were falling apart and I just didn't like them. Also, I didn't say to her,  it had too much wonton wrap and the filling was only the size of a grape and tough; because it was over cooked.) She then proceeded to get angry at me and tell me there was nothing wrong with them so why didn't I like them. I tried to explain I didn't say they are bad just that I don't like them over cooked. She continued to angrily tell me I am wrong and there's nothing wrong with them; they are fresh. I felt as though I was being scolded by my mother for not eating my vegetables. It was not the response I expected and inappropriate. She gave me a soup to go for free as a compensation but her behavior and attitude were disrespectful and not how a customer should be treated.",

The key is the unprofessional service and unauthentic  Vietnam restaurant.There are only few pieces of meat and a ball in the house pho, which is not worth $14 at all. I have eaten many Vietnamese dishes, and they are very unauthentic. We will not come again.",

Once seated we were told that, due to the weather, all of their outside reservations needed to be moved inside and therefore it was going to be very busy within the next 30-60 minutes. That was fine with us as we just wanted to eat and leave to finish running errands. We were given water and menus. We proceeded to wait for 15 minutes for a server to return to take our order. Within that time several other tables of customers had been seated and helped by servers, as we were ignored. At that point we decided to leave and find somewhere else that was willing and able to accommodate us. My husband and I have been to this restaurant before and have enjoyed the food. However, this evening we felt as though the customer service was completely lacking. If they were unable to accommodate us, due to not having a reservation, they could have been forthcoming about that upon our arrival. Instead they sat us, basically told us we need to hurry up and then proceeded to ignore us. We are very disappointed with the service and have never been treated as such an inconvenience.",

Last night, I ordered takeout in order to relax and dine at home. Online, I ordered my standby Thai comfort dish of Basil Sauce with a side of brown rice. I arrived at the Pine Ridge location to find the dinner rush had passed and 4 tables inside and 5 outside had diners. There were 3 servers and a kitchen staff of who knows how many but at least 3 different faces appeared at the small counter where servers pickup meals from the kitchen.\n\nWhile not busy, no employee made eye contact much less saying hello and or offering a \"Someone will be with you shortly\" greeting or whatever. With 2 other takeout customers there before me I joined their queue near a table laden with food in containers but none of it was going anywhere. More takeout containers came out of the kitchen and were placed on the table. After being there for at least 15 minutes with still no acknowledgement of my presence by anyone who worked there, one server/hostess came over to the table, sat down, spread out 6 take-out order receipts, starting reading them and sorted through the 15 or more containers on the able  to match each item to the proper printed receipt. No receipt had a complete order so the server got up and performed some other tasks. Meanwhile, a new take-out customer who ordered online and was completely ignored. All the while, the take-out food is cooling.\nMore food came out of the kitchen and was put on the table by the server/hostess and more receipts were read and containers were matched to an order. Finally, one of the customers there before  me had a complete order, paid and left. My term came next except, the side of brown rice still wasn't ready. It was forgotten. The server/hostess went to the kitchen and brought back the brown rice. I should have opened every container and checked it personally before paying but I didn't. My big mistake. Whatever sauce I was given was far different from the usual, it was not spiced properly but I added my own chili pepper sauce at home. The basil used was not fresh but dried out stems and fibrous. The brown rice was a glutinous mass of rice mush so overcooked and dried out and cold that the scoop of rice was glued together and there were no individual rice grains separable from the mass, just different degrees of textured mush. Disgusting.\n\nWill I go back again. Maybe, but only as a last resort as there are other Thai restaurants in the area. Oh well, every meal is an adventure. Sometimes they end really well and other times ...",

I decided to bring a couple of my colleagues who had never been and I had hyped them up about how good the food was. We got a bunch of appetizers and I got the basil chicken with rice (a dish I used to always get) for my entree but the taste was just not good. Sauce was very sweet, seems like they may have changed the recipe. Although the food was not great, I was still having a good experience. That was until I mentioned the coupon.. Our server said we were not eligible for the coupon as it was only allowed to be used for dinner service. However, no where in the email is this stated. The only small print mentioned that the 20% off any order or 50% off $50 can not be combined. Even if this was their intention (only having the coupon for dinner) a well run restaurant would still honor the coupon and update the email for future guests. However, this was not done. She did end up calling a manager who gave us 20% off our order but in my opinion this is still not the right thing to do. When I was younger, I worked in the service industry for years and understand how the treat customers. I hope Komoon learns from this experience but for the time being I will not be recommending or returning to their restaurants. I hope your experience is better than mine.",

We also ordered the Cuban sandwich and that too was the best Cuban we have ever had.  The meat was smoked beautifully and the bread ratio was perfect and crunchy on the outside with all the right flavors.

We were a few minutes late which wasn\u2019t an issue it seemed to the host, so we waited a few minutes which again was not an issue, totally our fault! We got seated and we (my husband and I) were the only ones at the table. Anyhow in the mean time after getting sat, our server was amazing! She was very friendly. We waited awhile to see if any other people were going to be seated with us and it ended up just being us two, which again totally fine with us. Well the cook came out and he was very well aware it was my birthday and legit cooked our food and that was it!!!!!! We\u2019ve been to Hibachi restaurants before (even this one) and the experience was NOTHING even worth paying for, which is what you pay for when you eat at a hibachi restaurant is the fun cooks and interactive experience even when it\u2019s not a special occasion. No flaming volcano, no interactive food \u201cgames\u201d  just plain out cooked our food and cleaning the table! Then to make the experience even better the closing bussers started using our table as a holding place for the salt/pepper shakers etc while we had had just had gotten our food and we\u2019re eating. The only thing the chef did different was sang happy birthday in his native language. It was severely underwhelming. Again I\u2019d like to say the server was amazing that is the only reason it\u2019s even getting 2 stars!",

Such a TERRIBLE experience for this restaurant category. The server was hurrying us all the time to order the food. The chef was kind, food good. His show was ok, nothing from other world.

Naples is the place for seafood, USS Nemo is where you get it upscale and elegant in the French style.  Recon the place at lunch.  Entrees are from about the same menu, but it will give you a chance to evaluate the very poor audio characteristics of the place which has a tin ceiling.  Not the fault of the chef-owner, but can be very noisy in the evening when at capacity and people are drinking.  Otherwise, superb in both food and service.",

Once seated we were told that, due to the weather, all of their outside reservations needed to be moved inside and therefore it was going to be very busy within the next 30-60 minutes. That was fine with us as we just wanted to eat and leave to finish running errands. We were given water and menus. We proceeded to wait for 15 minutes for a server to return to take our order. Within that time several other tables of customers had been seated and helped by servers, as we were ignored. At that point we decided to leave and find somewhere else that was willing and able to accommodate us. My husband and I have been to this restaurant before and have enjoyed the food. However, this evening we felt as though the customer service was completely lacking. If they were unable to accommodate us, due to not having a reservation, they could have been forthcoming about that upon our arrival. Instead they sat us, basically told us we need to hurry up and then proceeded to ignore us. We are very disappointed with the service and have never been treated as such an inconvenience.",

I can't say enough about how rich, savory, and delicious it was. I chose Moros and Tostones as sides and both were delicious with the stew.  Our group will be back!
