My new favorite Chinese restaurant!\n\nDai Yee's is higher quality Chinese food which is why it is priced a few dollars more than your typical Chinese carryout location. In my opinion it's worth paying for superior quality...you can clearly tell that the vegetables and chicken are fresh at Dai Yee's. Plus the favors are fantastic.\n\nDai Yee's is especially good if you're getting Chinese food for guests because it'll make a great impression. The menu is huge so many fun things to try.",

The service is always good, the food is better and the prices are reasonable, maybe even a tiny bit cheaper than other similar restaurants.\n\nGreat place to go if you have a mixed group of vegan/vegetarians and meat eaters because there are some great options for all so no one feels like they're compromising or missing out. I don't have any restrictions but I've tried some of the vegan versions when I've gone with my partner, and I think in particular the vegan duck soup (they switch the noodles to make the dish vegan) is great. I don't think vegans will miss the taste of duck with that dish, it's pretty spot on and even the texture is good. But there are of course other options and they're clearly labeled which is also super helpful.\n\nIt's just off the Western stop so a good place to eat right before or after taking the train.",

The kicker that prompted me to write this positive review was how helpful the woman was who answered the phone when I called because UberEats delivered the wrong order. I received a much smaller order for someone with a similar name. The restaurant said I could keep the extra items, and then quickly made the missing items and sent their own delivery driver to get them to me as quickly as they could. Even the driver was very unwilling to keep the small tip I offered him, as a thank you for getting it out to me.\n\nWe're appreciative that they worked to fix our situation and will be ordering from them again in the future!",

The rice tasted like soy sauce and I never saw or tasted any pork.  The soup also looked great but was just as bland. I ended up tossing it.

There's rice bowls and pork buns, but also chicken sandwiches and fries. It should satisfy both eastern and western cravings.\n\nEverything felt very casual, you grab your own water and to-go boxes in the back. Restrooms are private and clean unisex, located near the kitchen. And the food came out pretty fast.\n\nThe chicken wings were the highlight. This is definitely a wing place. Crispy and tender and full of flavor. I wouldn't mind trying every wing flavor on the menu.\n\nI didn't know what the fried buns were when I ordered, but I wanted to try them. Turns out they're kinda like donuts. Came with a side of icing to dip in too. Not too sweet, hot and fresh. Great simple appetizer.\n\nThe rice bowl was a nice big portion of rice and chicken with some lettuce and a white sauce that reminded me of the stuff you put on gyros.

That\u2019s fine, I figured their kitchen is busy so we didn\u2019t think much of it. After dinner as we were getting ready to cut the cake, our server (also the same server I asked prior to being seated) said Daebak does not allow cakes to be served. We asked why and they informed us it was just because the owner said so. Why was it not mentioned when I initially asked to place the cake in their fridge? We asked to speak to the owner and the server said they spoke to the owner and they wouldn\u2019t talk to us. As you can understand our family were extremely displeased as it was not mentioned earlier before we were seated that we can not cut and eat celebration cakes. At the end we ended up spending $360 at a restaurant that does not allow their customers to celebrate their birthdays with cake. Extremely disappointed to say the least. What was meant to be a nice celebration and dinner left everyone feeling deflated.\n\nEdit*\nBecause we were not able to cut our cake last night, we went out again tonight to properly celebrate her birthday. We went next door to Cai. Food was delicious and prices are very reasonable.\n20% gratuity was not automatically applied but we tipped well over that. Service was friendly as well.",

This tiny spot in noble street has various selection of different foods that I was able to explore and I highly recommend their kitchen sink sandwiches but before that this place is just seriously a great spot, it is a usual small spot selling good food. I've been to the place for a lot of times actually and it is always clean and the vibe is kind of pretty chill and casual. The staff in here is friendly and they even gave me recommendation when I went here for the first time. For the times that I visited this spot, I have tried and explore their menu but I would say that their kitchen sink sandwich is the best. It is a sandwich with a huge portion and generous amount of meat. It is just so good that I would never get tired of ordering it each time I would visit the place. Their chicken empanada is also good that I always love to order for sides.",

Due to the political climate of Chicago and Nini's strong Christian values, many past customers do not see eye to eye with Nini's Deli and choose to write fake reviews about the food and the staff/owner.  I've always been treated with 100% respect and treated well at Nini's, both before and after the political issues of 2020.  If you are looking for what is STILL the best food and hospitality, look no further than Nini's Deli.  I remember when I first tried Nini's Deli in 2019 how blown away I was by the food.  It's still the same.  Good food should UNITE people, cultures, you name it... not tear them apart.  There are other religions in Chicago that go against others core beliefs in Chicago - they just haven't been vocal about it like Nini's Deli.",
