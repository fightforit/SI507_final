Not only was the waiter, Jean, attentive, respectful, and checking in several times throughout the meal, but he was professional and able to give solid, varying recommendations for both food and drink.\n\nThe pricing, as it should, varies. Simpler, affordable, and authentic meals were priced just like any other restaurant you'd find, but at a higher quality. I had the Beijing Duck, and although knowing it is more expensive, is more than worth every dollar; in fact, getting the whole duck may be the right move next time!\n\nHands down one of the best meals I've had in Miami, with a safe and beautiful area to walk and take pictures after your meal. There was so much I wanted to try, I had to get a completely different dish to go. You'll be hard pressed to find a more unique and serene place to go in the Downtown Brickell area, for sure.\n\nSee you next time!",

The crunch of the sweet pickle inside made it the perfect texture combination for me. We tried the Peking duck, also. So good, it has me wanting to try all of the duck dishes they offer! It's been difficult to find a place that serves Beef Chow Fun in Miami (Flat Rice Noodle). This was our main attraction and the reason we drove 20 min to get there from another part of town.

That about sums up this place.\n\nOthers reviews have covered this place well - excellent food, large portions, reasonable prices, and friendly service.\n\nThe crab maw soup was a great starter.   They bring out white pepper you can add for some spiciness and a mild red vinegar for a little tartness so you can season it to taste.  The soup has a mild but rich flavor that is also fine by itself.   I was told they make their own tofu here and their fried version of it was fantastic.  Definitely some of the best I've had.\n\nWe rounded out the meal with some steamed fish (delicious) and some greens with garlic (also very good).   I'd recommend asking for some of their ginger/scallion sauce on the side.  They cook with it but it's a delicious, salty, sauce that can add a lot of flavor to a dish.   We asked to bring some home with the leftovers because it was so good.   Highly recommend stopping by here if you want some great Chinese food.",

I don't go to South Miami very often,  but this place is definitely on point with their Cuban food and the experiences was great!  Our Cuban friends took us to this place  and we sat outside since the weather was chilly that weekend. I loved the look and the atmosphere it was great! If you are visiting South Florida or local and looking for good Cuban food, then this is the place to go! They have a lot of authentic and some Americanized dishes which gives it a unique experience all around for everyone. Their prices are not that bad either I would say average comparing it to most places in South Florida. I ordered the  shredded pork  and it was very tender not dry at all. My husband ordered a Cuban sandwich and it was huge! The rest of our party ordered other dishes as well and we all sampled off from each other and still they were delicious! If you are looking for good Cuban food for those who are out of town guest or for yourself, then I definitely recommend Old Havana Cuban restaurant! I recommend the back patio area if the weather is nice. There are a lot of Spanish restaurants all up and down on 8th street, but I definitely recommend checking out this place if you haven't yet.",

Make sure to get here early, as this place did fill up quite quick. They have a nice patio out front, which also fills up fast. They also do to go orders here which I saw a lot of people doing.",

The dessert (flan) was just ok, but the rest of the food was really delicious.\n\nTwo of us shared a Cuban sandwich and the others ordered their own. The fresh squeezed orange juice was really fresh squeezed -- at most other places, the term \"fresh squeezed\" is interpreted in any which way the place wants to -- here, they take the term seriously.\n\nBetween the four of us, our bill with taxes and gratuity was $100. This place is a bit pricey for a diner and this is the reason why I knocked off a star; otherwise, it was all good.",

I ordered an entree that had steak, chicken, shrimp, fried rice, and onions. The only flavor in the bowl was the onions. No seasoning on any of the meats. The only reason I\u2019m giving a one star is because it was $14.99, but was big enough for 3 small servings. My wife had garlic chicken with rice, and it was not very good. We took home as leftovers and ate the next day (because we didn\u2019t want to waste it) and the chicken tasted absolutely awful in both dishes. The men also kept winking at my wife, which she did not welcome. Overall an uncomfortable and disappointing experience.",
