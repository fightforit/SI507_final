If you don't care about the taste and service at all and just want to throw your money away, this is your place. Be careful with everything, otherwise you will be lectured by the waitress \"kindly\". This is the first time I got questioned by a waitress \"What is wrong with you? Don't you understand?\" How can you talk to me like that while expecting me to tip you? They would also keep checking on you in case you get too comfortable. An epic experience I will never forget. Now I'm feeling throw up not only because of the greasy food, but also in deep regret of my decision to come here.\n\nBtw, tipping is not mandatory in the United States. Just so the owner know.",

The biggest thing that I had heard from friends was to stick to the tapas and skip the paella. As a paella fan, I decided that I needed to try it. This proved to be a mistake\n\nWe got the Valentine's Day menu, which included a few tapas (you don't get to choose), and the lobster paella, followed by a dessert.\n\nOne thing to note here is that the drinks and wine selection are really excellent. Can't fault them there.\n\nThe tapas we received were really disappointing. The bruschetta tasted like the tomatoes came from a can, there was another forgettable vegetarian dish, and the third dish was a fried cheese dish. On the whole,  definitely nothing to write home about.\n\nThe most unfortunate portion of the entire meal was the lobster paella. The rice in the paella was mostly flavorless, the calamari was decent, but the lobster was extremely overcooked. I've never had lobster this dry. It was a real shame.\n\nThe dessert was some chocolate souffle, fine but also forgettable.\n\nFor the price, the quality of food is not there. Aventura is all form and no function. It's regrettable because the space is gorgeous and I really wanted to like the food. Spanish food is really fantastic. I've been to Spain. I've had Tapas. It's really not that difficult to do well. Aventura simply was not. I hope that they can work to improve their menu because they are onto a good concept, just severely lacking in execution.",

Our table had 3 paella, 2 of them were great, the third fell flat and was left largely untouched, which went overlooked, no offer to exchange or remove the $70 plate of rice.\n\nThe bad: Price. Man, I've been to Spanish tapas places all over, and I'd never call them budget friendly bites, but our bill for 2 people was $340 after tax & tip. The other couples in our party were in the same ballpark. That's without bottles of wine. At half that price I'm a little bummed but I'd go back. I'm not sure I'll be back.",

The food was good, nothing special.  You do get a lot of food.  But, they are very dishonest about the wait times.  We were told 35 to 40 minutes.  I arrived at 6:35pm (exactly 35 minutes), figuring I might have to wait another 5 minutes or so.  When I came in, they first had me sign the credit card receipt and then told me it would be another 15-20 minutes.  I told the staff person that it would be good to be honest to begin with about the wait times.  About 15 minutes later they called me up again and told me it would be yet another 15 to 20 minutes.  They didn\u2019t have my food ready until just before 7:30pm - I waited almost 55 minutes at the restaurant.  While I was there, others came in and said the restaurant had called them to let them know it would be a longer wait (total of an hour).  We were never called.  After they had them pay their bills, they then told these other customers that they would also wait another 15 to 20 minutes.  It was interesting that they were clearly making sure they got payment BEFORE telling the customers they would need to wait addition time for their food.  The whole thing was very dishonest.  This was not the only issue we had.  We ordered my daughter\u2019s meal specifically with \u201cjust pesto and pasta, nothing else.\u201d  This was reiterated several times on the phone and we were told that would not be a problem to do.  When I got home with the food, my daughter\u2019s pasta had ricotta and mozzarella vegan cheese on top of it - even though the lid stated that it was \u201cjust pesto and pasta.\u201d  How can a person write that while looking at the meal and seeing that it clearly had addition ingredients on it?  We are all very disappointed with our experience.  All they had to do was be honest up front about the wait times.  We would not have been upset that they were busy and had long wait times, if they had been honest about it.\n\nIn response to the owners:  I was told that the reason for the long wait time was that the online system was down and that the restaurant was very busy.  Another customer was told the same thing.  At no point did anyone mention an injured chef.  Again, honesty is always the best way to go.  Clearly if we had been told a chef had been injured, we would have been much more understanding of the situation.  Even if it was the online system (which really doesn\u2019t make sense), we would have been understanding.  It was the lack of honesty that was the issue and still is the issue.",

The ones last night was oozing ingredients and falling onto the plate with every bite. The ones tonight reminded me of a Taco Bell size taco. Should have ordered two. Not much substance and the tacos weren\u2019t bursting with flavor like the ones we had last night. Can\u2019t say it was because we ordered something different because we ordered the exact same. The flavor was good but again not as good as the ones from last night in Pitt.\n\nCan\u2019t wait to go back to The Pitt location.\n\nNow, my husband wasn\u2019t with us last night so he had nothing to compare it to so he really liked the taco and nachos.

They expected us to know that we were supposed to order, then sit down and wait for food.  I ordered the daily special with a beef taco, received a chicken taco.

The egg was over cooked, the broth was yummy but maybe less strictly authentic, but the pork belly was perfect and everything was very balanced and fresh, well made. The space is small, but cozy.

We were five girls and all wore masks. Moreover, we were standing OUTSIDE the restaurant and waiting. One of us guessed the space was getting crowded so he was upset. However, there were a bunch of other people and he just came straight to us with his nasty attitude. Moreover, he got EXTREMELY close to us, which could be considered harassment and definitely broke the rule of 6 feet. The other waiter came soon and got us seated, and we thought that's all since we would have a different waiter.\nWe ordered a BBQ combo and spicy chicken with cheese. The BBQ Appetizers were good and authentic, but the meats were lack of flavor and were not fresh. The spicy chicken was with a lot of cheese - which was great! But it also didn't have any flavor and was burning spicy.\nWhile we were chatting AND EATING, the same waiter with punk hair who just yelled at us came to our table again and commanded us to wear our masks if we were \"just talking\" or we should \"get the F out of here.\" This place was so understaffed and we didn't know what to do because nobody was around except this guy. We were so disgusted and quickly left. It really took me some time to recover from this traumatized experience and write this review eventually. Don't come to this place, especially when you are all young girls because some of the people here are just so mean!!",

Instead of explaining nicely that they were understaffed at the moment, he chose to have a bad attitude and told us to mind our own businesses and NOT TELL HIM HOW TO DO HIS JOB.

Please take into considerate how much more business you actually could have. Atleast find a middle ground. Simply look at the pictures of the menus in the pictures google has of the store and you can see the price of the menu increase over time. lower price to a moderate and reasonable level like they once were.

I waited for 1.5 hours in the restaurant and eventually had to drop the order after learning the other customer had waited for 2 hours. They never came up with any solutions and just kept you waiting forever. Yes, I love their food. But I would suggest you either order 4 hours ahead or just dine in. They prioritize their dine in customer so take out order will have to wait for hours.",

Tom Yum soup tasted mostly just salty and like it had been made from simple bouillon; no complex flavors. Curry was watered down more than creamy and had very little chicken. Not sure if owners/cooks have changed or if the pandemic caused cost saving measures that decreased food quality, but I'm feeling sad and disappointed and missing our favorite Thai food.",

The wait staff is very young\u2014super nice, but some are maybe a little unskilled in paying attention to service. The egg was over cooked, the broth was yummy but maybe less strictly authentic, but the pork belly was perfect and everything was very balanced and fresh, well made. The space is small, but cozy. Really, the staff and space could have been awful and I\u2019d still want to eat here every day. The steamed buns were perfect. The noodles were perfect. Ann Arbor is very lucky.",

We arrived at 7:50 a.m. and proceeded to walk in to the open restaurant door.  One of the employees informed us that the restaurant was not open until 8 a.m. I inquired that since it was cold out, could we wait right inside the door. We were told no, which seemed a little unreasonable since the restaurant at that point would be opening in less than 10 minutes and since it was early Sunday morning there was not much else open nearby. We left and came back at 8. When we were seated,  we were a little disgusted to see that right under our table was a used mask and a dirty fork. We looked around the restaurant and saw another table had a crumpled up napkin on the floor. And a third table also had a mask under it. Since we were literally the first customers to come in, it is apparent that the floors had nor been cleaned at closing the day before.  Despite all this, we stayed and enjoyed our breakfast.  The food was good, although way overpriced especially considering the condition of the floors of the restaurant.  I would have expected more from a restaurant that charges that much for the food, which was only good, hardly great. Our waitress, however,  was attentive and prompt in her service.

I know they're struggling with staffing issues, but man, this was rough.\n\nWe came out at 3PM on a weekday, were one of the only two indoor tables that were occupied at the time, and it still took us 45+ mins to get our food. The mimosas tided us over a little, but our waitress barely checked in on us for refills, nor did she have much of a presence at all. She only refilled our drinks when our food finally came out nearly an hour later\u2014my shakshuka's eggs were overcooked and so was the chicken on my mom's salad. Again, things would be different if they were busy, but there was no midday crowd (by the time we got our food we were the only occupied table indoors!) They started to mop right beside our table just as we finally began to eat, too, and the strong smell of bleach did nothing to help what was already mediocre food. Our waitress checked on us again only after we had finished our dishes to give us our check, and that was that.\n\nI'm really sad. What was supposed to be a fun retread of an old favourite turned into a bill that was $90+ for two disappointing meals (with really small portions) and all around disappointing service. I want to come back, see they've improved, and write a better review because I don't want to see another A2 favourite leave town, but I'm not sure I'm ready to take that risk again. I hope they can read their reviews and see where they need to improve.\n\n...At least the blood orange mimosas were good!",

The presentation is fantastic, the talk they give for you is nice. The food, is of course so good. If you do $75 dinner option the portion is pretty huge, but it could depend on the time and menu, I guess? This is probably the only fine dining restaurant I can recommend to anyone who\u2019d like to have a full experience and amazing dishes for special occasions. - and don\u2019t forget grab some wines their selections are quite interesting even I don\u2019t know much about wines could see how unique each wine is.

We were greeted by an incredibly rude hostess who scolded us for being 10 minutes ahead of time. It wasn\u2019t like it was wall to wall w/ people desperately clawing for brunch, the entire front area was open. So, I sincerely apologize to the incompetent host for overwhelming you with a 4 top. Also, i apologizing for asking where the restroom was. I\u2019m sure that was stressful/hard for you to answer while you were standing there ignoring calls :/\n\nToday was my third visit to Cafe Zola & the other two experiences were no different. To whoever the hiring manager is, do better with who you\u2019re selecting to represent/run a small business.\n\nFor those of you looking for a brunch place, don\u2019t worry ! If the high prices for mediocre food were already deterring you, the inattentive waitstaff should add to it as well. Don\u2019t go here ! ",

I was referred to the classic.  The Classic has a crepe with egg, bacon, cheese and avocado inside.\n\nI is served in what I would describe a small pizza type cardboard box.  I had to wait a bit which was fine.  You enter and there is a counter with a menu up on the wall behind.  There are no tables to sit at here.  It is take out only.  Maybe in the Summer they have two tables outside.\n\nThe crepe itself tasted great.  However, the bacon in side was what I would term raw barely heated.  I worry that you could get trichinosis. The cheese is piled in one spot.  It should be spread out more.  The avocado is like one slice cut up in a few pieces.  After seeing the bacon the way it was I took it home and cooked it until it was crisp.  Red not pink.  I was surprised that it was tasteless.  Never have I had bacon that had no taste.  Often when you eat this you get a lot of crepe only.  No contents.  On the whole it was very bland.\n\nI hope that their sweet crepes are better.  But I will not be returning.",

He took the time to explain to us what was vegan and also gave us some ideas for dishes that they could make vegan. We were considering a vegetable biryani but he made sure we knew that butter was used in cooking it. We were very happy with the service! There was four of us dining together and every dish we ordered was delicious. We will definitely be eating there again!",

I put the order in on square right before they opened and called when I arrived for the curbside service. She said it would just be a few minutes. Ten minutes later a man with an ipad approached my car, asked for my name and checked the order and said it would be a few more minutes. Twenty minutes later I called in to the restaurant and she said the order had been ready. I signed up for curbside service and had already generously tipped. She brought the food out and practically threw it in my window. It isn't about the wait. A simple \"Sorry for your wait\" or even smile and I would have given 5 stars.

It's just regular old French toast but it's made perfectly every time. soft eggy on the inside with a nice light brown crisp outer, powdered sugar and cinnamon so delicious. The Greek Burger is delicious pork chops and eggs steak and eggs coneys. I haven't had anything I didn't enjoy from this place. Staff is amazing friendly. Highly recommend",

I suggest giving it a try!\n\n============================================\n7/2/2018\n\nI do not recommend eating here if you have specific requests and expect good customer service. I asked for my pita to be made with no sauce and sauce on the side because I know that I am picky in that I don't like soggy sandwiches, where you can't taste anything outside of the sauce. They refused to make it for me in this way.\n\nI still decided to order, stressing that there please be light sauce. When I opened up the sandwich it had a lot of sauce and the pita bread was soggy. Furthermore, one half had meat the the other half only had one tiny piece of meat.\n\nWhen calling back about my dissatisfaction of the sandwich, they did not rectify the situation in any way besides saying the sandwich was made with half the sauce as usual and ' I'm sorry'.\n\nI will give 2 stars because the first time I came here they listened to my request for the sauce to be on the side and, I really enjoyed the lamb kafta. Even though there was too much sauce & sogginess this time, the meat tasted good.",

So good! The menu is typical for a Coney Island, but the cook(s) lift it above the norm. I haven't really tried the breadth of the menu, because their chicken lemon soup is easily the best I have ever had, and I could order that every day and not get tired of it. My granddaughter, being more experimental, has tried several dishes and enjoyed each one.",

Best lunch I've had in a long time, and I love to experiment with food so there's a lot of competition there. This location opened 2 weeks before lockdown, so for them to still be here should tell you everything you need to know. With all of the restaurants going out of business because of COVID, for one to survive it means they've got their menu and products down to a science. Very rich high quality meats, perfectly toasted bread; crispy, and not at all burnt. I'd include photos but I was a little too excited and finished my sandwich before it even crossed my mind. This isn't sponsored and I've no relation to the owner or any workers, it's just incredible food and service, and I'm hoping they get the recognition they deserve.

For those who are unfamiliar like I was, they really don't use utensils.  You can request them if you really want to, but I recommend diving in head first and eat like they do. They give you this sourdough spongy bread that you use to pick up your food (the menu explains it all).  The spices they used are amazing and reminded me of a cross between Indian and Thai spices. Everything we ordered was delicious.  We did a shareable of three veggies and two meats, all spicy of course. They have mild, too. But honestly, the spicy isn't overpowering. It's just enough to say hello.  Try at least ONE spicy thing just for the flavor. I can't wait to make up another excuse to go to Lansing and try more things from Altu's.",

Considering that this restaurant a) is not cheap, b) is very highly regarded, and c) has online ordering where you specify what time you're coming to pickup, I feel like the long wait time is not okay. Both times, the staff didn't bother to address/explain the delay. We ordered two signature dishes and made the order WAY in advance, so it's not like we were being difficult customers. I will say that the food has a comforting home-cooked feel and a special wholesome quality. I also appreciated that they honored my request to replace the rice with beans. However, we just don't have the time (or honestly, the patience) to wait half an hour for a takeout order these days. There are so many other exciting new restaurants in Detroit now, and we probably won't be returning to this one, unfortunately.",

My husband had the goat shank, and we also tried a side of the flash fried fish and the spinach with peanuts. Every single thing I have tasted here is incredible. It's more than just delicious- it's an experience. The spices are all so warm and comforting- especially appreciated in this chilly weather. The spiced coffee and avocado-passion fruit pudding is a wonderful way to end a meal. We also had a chance to speak with the owner who was very kind and obviously motivated to share his story and culture. From what I understood,  he thinks we Americans are living too fast, and this affects all aspects of our lives from raising children to enjoying food. He said that you have to put as much time into your food as the pleasure and quality you want to get out of it. Hearing the story of how the restaurant came to be was very interesting- I suggested that he write a cookbook that also tells his story, and/or even teach classes. I would LOVE to learn how to cook like this. If he decides to teach, I will be ready to learn.",

Not too long ago the city had installed street lights and it seemed things were moving in a positive direction. I drove up and down Woodward and noticed this block had some shuttered businesses. I thought it was such a shame being so close to the truly inspiring Fischer building a few hundred feet away and having a desolate block such as this sitting here. I remember seeing that something had popped up, it had eye catching designs on the windows and seemed to be some kind of eatery and I paid it no mind until this place was mentioned in Eater Detroit as one of the city\u2019s up and coming gems. The branding is fantastic. The decor is inviting and sleek. The atmosphere is electric. The staff was very pleasant and there were smiles all around. It seemed like not only was this amazing corner spot being filled but it was occupied with an establishment that would be here to stay. Finally, we ordered our dishes. As excited as I was about the demeanor of the restaurant nothing could have prepared me for such an incredible disarming plate. I felt like I was back at home, I grew up eating Afro-Caribbean cuisine. This type of food was very similar to what I had in my youth but of course just a bit different. I had the marinated chicken with yellow beans, rice pilau, and plantains. The plantains were exceptional and clearly made by someone who knows what good plantains are supposed to taste like. The chicken was perfect. Flavorful, hot, and tender. I could easily eat the yellow beans every day and never tire of them. My partner had never tried anything like this and most of our meal was in silence, we were blown away. I\u2019m writing this no less than 15 minutes after we exited the restaurant. If you\u2019re wondering whether or not to go out in this (at the time) frigid February weather, put on your coat and boots. Warm up the car. Head to baobab fare and thank me later. One of the best restaurants in Detroit hands down and honestly I\u2019d say top three in the city. Look out, you got yourself a couple of new regulars.",

The biggest thing that I had heard from friends was to stick to the tapas and skip the paella. As a paella fan, I decided that I needed to try it. This proved to be a mistake\n\nWe got the Valentine's Day menu, which included a few tapas (you don't get to choose), and the lobster paella, followed by a dessert.\n\nOne thing to note here is that the drinks and wine selection are really excellent. Can't fault them there.\n\nThe tapas we received were really disappointing. The bruschetta tasted like the tomatoes came from a can, there was another forgettable vegetarian dish, and the third dish was a fried cheese dish. On the whole,  definitely nothing to write home about.\n\nThe most unfortunate portion of the entire meal was the lobster paella. The rice in the paella was mostly flavorless, the calamari was decent, but the lobster was extremely overcooked. I've never had lobster this dry. It was a real shame.\n\nThe dessert was some chocolate souffle, fine but also forgettable.\n\nFor the price, the quality of food is not there. Aventura is all form and no function. It's regrettable because the space is gorgeous and I really wanted to like the food. Spanish food is really fantastic. I've been to Spain. I've had Tapas. It's really not that difficult to do well. Aventura simply was not. I hope that they can work to improve their menu because they are onto a good concept, just severely lacking in execution.",
